Autmated Greenhouse Machine

We're proposing creating software that would use a Raspberry Pi to take in sensor information 
(temperature/humidity/soil pH) and use altorithms to adjust conditions in the greenhouse
(water plants, turn on fan or lights, ping the user to adjust soil pH).

Ideas for creating stretch goals would be things like integrating information about energy useage
or creating web/phone apps to allow the user to make manual adjustments based on what sensor information
is being collected.
